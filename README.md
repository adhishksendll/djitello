DJI Tello Project

This is my personal project which I have coded in Python exclusively for the DJI Tello. Around 80% of the project is compatible with other programmable drones, keeping in mind the minor changes will have to be made to make the program compatible with other drones. I will be updating and documenting my progress here. When the project is complete I will rename the README file to README(Complete).

Timeline:

v1.0.0: 
The program allows you to control the drone with your keyboard. [KeyboardControl.py]

v1.0.1: 
The program has integrated keyboard control with live video feed from the drone in seperate tabs. [Project-KeyboardControlImageCapture.py]
The program can now show the drone's flight path. [Mapping.py]

v1.0.2:
Face tracking feature has been added. [FaceTracking.py]
