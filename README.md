DJI Tello Project

This is my personal project coded in Python exclusively for the DJI Tello.

Timeline:

v1.0.0: 
The program allows you to control the drone with your keyboard.

v1.0.1: 
The program has integrated keyboard control with live video feed from the drone in seperate tabs.
The program can now show the drone's flight path.
